# Analyzing Youtube trending videos

### Background
Youtube has a special section for videos that are trending or quickly growing in popularity. However, this does not mean that videos in trending will be the most viewed in the long run.

### Goals
1. To find interesting data and trends about the videos - for example, how long do videos stay in the trending page and how fast do they usually trend, what are the most popular categories and tags and how much do the contents of different
countriesâ€™ trending pages differ from each other.
2. Build models to predict views for videos on their last day in the trending page and whether a video stays in trending for more than one day.

### Data
Our dataset is from Kaggle and it contains info about trending videos from 10 different countries from the period 14.11.2017 until 31.05.2018. There is info about publish time, trending date, view/like/dislike/comment count, description, tags, etc. <br>
